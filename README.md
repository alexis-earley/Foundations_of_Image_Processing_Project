This was a project I participated in through one of my first programming classes. To do it, I initially studied the 
organization of .tga image files. I was then able to use this knowledge to load the images provided (contained in the "input"
folder) and construct the rest of the code. I used basic image manipulation processes, such as multiplying, overlaying, and rotating,
to manipulate various inputs. In total, I completed ten different tasks. After each one, the results were stored in a new .tga image file.

In addition to the main and header, I wrote the pixel and image files (the pixel class is nested within the image one). In other
words, no C++ files were provided for me. At the time, it was my longest project to date, around 850 lines of code in total. This project 
demonstrates my early knowledge of header/main files in C++, file manipulation, classes, pointers/references, and basic image processing. 

Score: 135 / 135.
