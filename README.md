This was a project I participated in through one of my first programming classes. I initially studied the 
organization of .tga image files. I was then able to use this knowledge to load the images provided (contained in the "input"
folder) and construct the rest of the code. I used basic image manipulation processes, such as multiplying, overlaying, and rotating,
to manipulate various inputs. In total, I completed ten different tasks. After each one, the results were stored in a new .tga image file.

In addition to the main and header, I wrote the pixel and image files (the pixel class is nested within the image one). In other
words, no C++ files were provided for me. At the time, it was my longest project to date, around 850 lines of code in total. This project 
demonstrates my early knowledge of concepts like:

 - Header and main files in C++
 - File manipulation
 - Classes
 - Pointers/references
 - Throwing exceptions
 - Basic image processing

Overall score: 135 / 135.
